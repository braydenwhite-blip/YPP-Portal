## 1. Authentication & Security

### 1.1 Email/Password Login

**What it does:** Standard credential-based login with email and password.

**How it works:**
- Handled by NextAuth.js `CredentialsProvider` in `lib/auth.ts`
- Passwords are hashed with `bcryptjs`
- Email must be verified before login is allowed
- Returns JWT session with user ID, roles, and primary role

**How to test:**
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter valid credentials → should redirect to `/` (dashboard)
3. Enter wrong password 5 times → account should lock for 30 minutes
4. Attempt login with unverified email → should show "verify your email" error
5. Attempt 10+ logins from same IP/email in 15 minutes → should receive rate limit error

---

### 1.2 Google OAuth Login

**What it does:** "Sign in with Google" button as an alternative to password.

**How it works:**
- Uses NextAuth.js `GoogleProvider`
- Requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars
- Creates or links user account via `OAuthAccount` model
- If no matching email exists, creates new account

**How to test:**
1. Go to `/login`
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete Google consent screen
4. Should be redirected to `/` on success
5. Verify `OAuthAccount` record created in database

---

### 1.3 Magic Link Authentication

**What it does:** Passwordless email sign-in — user receives a one-time login link.

**How it works:**
- User submits email at `/magic-link`
- System generates a signed token stored in `PasswordResetToken` table
- Email is sent with a link containing the token
- Clicking the link logs the user in without a password

**How to test:**
1. Go to `/magic-link`
2. Submit a valid email
3. Check email for login link
4. Click the link → should be logged in
5. Click the link again → should fail (token consumed)

---

### 1.4 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**What it does:** TOTP-based second factor using an authenticator app.

**How it works:**
- Enabled from `/settings/security`
- Uses TOTP standard (Google Authenticator, Authy compatible)
- Secret encrypted with `TWO_FACTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Recovery codes generated and stored in `TwoFactorRecovery` table
- After correct password, user is challenged for TOTP code

**How to test:**
1. Log in as any user
2. Go to `/settings/security` → Enable 2FA
3. Scan QR code with authenticator app
4. Enter TOTP code to confirm setup
5. Log out, log back in → should see 2FA challenge screen
6. Enter correct TOTP → logged in
7. Use a recovery code instead → should also work

---

### 1.5 Email Verification

**What it does:** Prevents login until user confirms their email address.

**How it works:**
- On signup, a token is saved to `EmailVerificationToken`
- Verification email sent with a link to `/verify-email?token=...`
- Clicking verifies the email and marks `User.emailVerified`
- Login is blocked until `emailVerified` is set

**How to test:**
1. Sign up with a new email at `/signup`
2. Attempt login immediately → should be blocked
3. Check email for verification link
4. Click link → email verified
5. Log in again → succeeds

---

### 1.6 Password Reset

**What it does:** Sends a time-limited reset link via email.

**How it works:**
- `/forgot-password` form submits email
- Token stored in `PasswordResetToken`, expires in 1 hour
- Link sent to email: `/reset-password?token=...`
- User sets new password, old token invalidated

**How to test:**
1. Go to `/forgot-password`, enter registered email
2. Check email for reset link
3. Click link → `/reset-password` form
4. Set new password, confirm
5. Log in with new password → success
6. Try the same reset link again → should fail (expired/used)

---

### 1.7 Rate Limiting & Account Lockout

**What it does:** Prevents brute-force attacks.

**How it works:**
- `lib/rate-limit.ts` / `lib/rate-limit-redis.ts` (Redis when available)
- 10 login attempts per email/IP per 15-minute window → HTTP 429
- 5 wrong passwords → account locked for 30 minutes
- Lockout stored on `User` model

**How to test:**
1. Attempt login with wrong password 5 times → account lock message
2. Wait 30 minutes or manually reset in DB → login works again
3. Make 10+ requests in 15 minutes from same IP → rate limit response

---

## 2. User Roles & Permissions

**What it does:** Controls what each user can see and do.

**Roles available:**

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ADMIN` | Full system access |
| `INSTRUCTOR` | Teach classes, manage curriculum |
| `STUDENT` | Enroll in courses, track progress |
| `MENTOR` | Mentor students and instructors |
| `CHAPTER_LEAD` | Oversee a chapter |
| `STAFF` | Internal YPP staff operations |
| `PARENT` | View child's progress |
| `APPLICANT` | Job applicant (pre-hire) |

**How it works:**
- Users can have multiple roles via `UserRole` join table
- `primaryRole` determines dashboard layout
- Route middleware (`middleware.ts`) enforces auth for protected pages
- Server actions call `requireAdmin()`, `requireAnyRole()`, etc.
- Navigation is filtered by role via `lib/navigation/resolve-nav.ts`

**How to test:**
1. Log in as each seeded test user and observe the different dashboard layouts
2. Try accessing `/admin` as a student → should be denied/redirected
3. Try accessing `/instructor-training` as a student → should be denied
4. Confirm each role sees only their relevant nav items

---

## 3. Unified Dashboard (Home Page)

**What it does:** A single command center tailored to the user's primary role, surfacing the most important tasks, metrics, and tools.

**How it works:**
- Route: `/` → `app/(app)/page.tsx`
- `lib/dashboard/data.ts` generates role-specific data server-side
- `lib/dashboard/resolve-dashboard.ts` formats it for display
- Feature flag: `ENABLE_UNIFIED_ALL_TOOLS_DASHBOARD` (env var) — falls back to legacy if false

**Dashboard sections:**

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| Role Hero | Welcome card with focus areas for the user's role |
| Daily Checklist | Today's tasks: check-in, recap, feedback, etc. |
| Queue Board | Prioritized work queues relevant to the role |
| Next Actions | Top 3 most urgent items to complete now |
| KPI Strip | Key metrics (enrolled students, completion %, etc.) |
| Tool Explorer | Searchable list of all tools available for the role |
| Pathway Widget | Active learning pathways with progress |
| Nudge Strip | Contextual prompts and helpful suggestions |
| Journey Roadmap | Milestone timeline showing overall progress |
| Instructor Readiness Widget | Training completion and interview status (instructors) |
| Launch Banners | Feature rollout announcements |

**How to test:**
1. Log in as Admin → verify admin-specific KPIs and queues appear
2. Log in as Instructor → verify training widget, course queues visible
3. Log in as Student → verify pathway widget, daily checklist visible
4. Log in as Mentor → verify mentee list and feedback queues visible
5. Complete a checklist item → verify it disappears or is checked off
6. Use the search in Tool Explorer (Cmd/Ctrl+K) → verify tools filter

---

## 4. Onboarding

**What it does:** Guides new users through account setup on first login.

**How it works:**
- Route: `/onboarding`
- Multi-step wizard in `components/onboarding/onboarding-wizard.tsx`
- Different steps per role: `student-steps.tsx`, `instructor-steps.tsx`
- `lib/onboarding-actions.ts` saves progress
- `POST /api/onboarding/complete` marks onboarding done on user record
- Redirect to `/onboarding` enforced in middleware for users with `onboardingComplete: false`

**How to test:**
1. Create a new user account
2. Log in → should automatically redirect to `/onboarding`
3. Complete each step
4. Final step → redirects to dashboard
5. Log out and back in → onboarding not shown again
6. Test both student and instructor onboarding flows with respective accounts

---

## 5. Instructor Training Academy

**What it does:** A structured training program that instructors must complete before they are approved to teach.

**How it works:**
- Route: `/instructor-training`
- Content defined in `data/training-academy/content.v1.json`, imported to database
- `TrainingModule` → `TrainingCheckpoint` → Completion tracked per user
- Four checkpoint types: `video`, `checkpoint`, `quiz`, `evidence`
- `lib/instructor-readiness.ts` computes overall readiness score per level
- `InstructorApproval` model tracks admin-granted approvals per level (101–401)
- `InstructorInterviewGate` enforces interview before first class offering

**Training checkpoint types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Video | Must watch a video (progress tracked via `VideoProgress`) |
| Checkpoint | Read/acknowledge a milestone |
| Quiz | Pass a quiz above a minimum score threshold |
| Evidence | Upload a file or photo as proof of completion |

**Interview gate:**
1. Instructor completes required modules
2. Instructor requests interview slots from admin (`InstructorInterviewSlot`)
3. Admin reviews availability, schedules interview
4. After passing interview, `InstructorInterviewGate.passed = true`
5. Instructor can now offer their first class

**How to test:**
1. Log in as Instructor (`avery.lin@...`)
2. Go to `/instructor-training`
3. Open a training module → complete each checkpoint type
4. Complete a quiz → verify pass/fail score handling
5. Upload evidence → verify file saved and checkpoint marked done
6. Complete all required modules → verify readiness % updates
7. Request an interview slot

- `ProgressUpdate` model: mentor submits a progress rating
- Progress levels: `BEHIND_SCHEDULE`, `GETTING_STARTED`, `ON_TRACK`, `ABOVE_AND_BEYOND`
- Displayed as a color-coded progress bar (red → yellow → green → blue)

**Routes:**
- `/goals` — user views assigned goals
- `/goals/custom` — user views custom goals
