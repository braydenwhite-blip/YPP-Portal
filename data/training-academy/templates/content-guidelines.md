# Content Guidelines
## YPP Instructor Academy Training Videos

---

## Purpose

These guidelines ensure all training videos maintain consistent quality, align with YPP values, and effectively support instructor development.

---

## 1. Tone & Voice

### The YPP Voice

**We are:**
- ✅ **Supportive** - We believe in every instructor's potential to grow
- ✅ **Professional** - We maintain high standards while being approachable
- ✅ **Empowering** - We equip instructors with practical tools and confidence
- ✅ **Authentic** - We share real examples, including challenges
- ✅ **Student-centered** - We always connect back to student impact

**We are NOT:**
- ❌ Condescending or patronizing
- ❌ Overly formal or academic
- ❌ Vague or theoretical without application
- ❌ Discouraging or deficit-focused
- ❌ One-size-fits-all or prescriptive

### Language Style

- **Use "you" language** - Speak directly to the instructor
  - ✅ "You'll design a lesson that..."
  - ❌ "Instructors design lessons that..."
- **Use active voice** - Make statements direct and clear
  - ✅ "Plan your opening in three steps"
  - ❌ "The opening should be planned in three steps"
- **Be conversational** - Write like you speak (but polished)
  - ✅ "Let's break this down..."
  - ❌ "This concept can be deconstructed as follows..."
- **Use inclusive language** - Avoid assumptions about identity, background, or experience
  - ✅ "Students," "learners," "they/them"
  - ❌ Gendered pronouns without context, assumptions about prior knowledge

## 2. Learning Objectives

### Every Video Must Have Clear Learning Objectives

**Format:** "By the end of this video, you will be able to..."

**Characteristics of Strong Learning Objectives:**
- **Observable** - Can be demonstrated or assessed
- **Specific** - Not vague or overly broad
- **Actionable** - Involves a verb (create, identify, apply, analyze)
- **Relevant** - Directly applicable to classroom practice

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
- "Identify the three non-negotiable class norms and explain why each matters"
- "Draft a 60-second class opening script using the provided template"
- "Apply the intervention ladder to respond to off-task behavior"

❌ **Too Vague:**
- "Understand classroom management"
- "Learn about assessment"
- "Become a better teacher"

### Alignment

Learning objectives should:
- Align with module checkpoints (what they'll do after watching)
- Connect to quiz questions (how we'll assess understanding)
- Build toward capstone readiness (whole-instructor preparation)

---

## 3. Content Structure

### The Standard Structure

1. **Hook** (0:00-0:30)
   - Grab attention with a relatable scenario, question, or striking statistic
   - Example: "Have you ever had a student shut down mid-class and you didn't know what to do?"

2. **Introduction** (0:30-1:00)
   - State learning objectives clearly
   - Preview what's coming
   - Establish why it matters

3. **Main Content** (Majority of video)
   - Break into 3-5 clear segments
   - Each segment = one core idea
   - Use examples liberally
   - Include checkpoints for reflection

4. **Summary** (Last 1-2 minutes)
   - Recap key takeaways (3-5 bullet points max)
   - Reinforce the "why" - connect to student impact
   - Provide clear next steps

### Pacing Guidelines

| Video Length | Segments | Key Points Per Segment |
|--------------|----------|------------------------|
| 3-5 min      | 1-2      | 1-2                    |
| 6-10 min     | 2-3      | 2-3                    |
| 11-20 min    | 3-5      | 2-4                    |
| 20+ min      | 5-7      | 2-4                    |

**Rule of Thumb:** Change visual or topic every 30-60 seconds to maintain engagement.

## 4. Examples vs. Theory Balance

### The 70/30 Rule

**70% Practical, 30% Theory**

- Prioritize concrete examples, demonstrations, and applications
- Include just enough theory/research to provide credibility and context
- Always answer: "How will I use this tomorrow?"

### Types of Examples

**Strong Examples Are:**
- **Specific** - Names, quotes, concrete details
- **Relatable** - Scenarios instructors will recognize
- **Diverse** - Represent varied student populations, class types, and contexts
- **Realistic** - Not idealized; include challenges and messiness

**Example Formats:**
- **Scenario walkthroughs** - "Imagine a student arrives 15 minutes late..."
- **Before/after comparisons** - "Here's a weak feedback example vs. a strong one"
- **Real artifacts** - Show actual lesson plans, feedback, student work (anonymized)
- **Video clips** - Demonstrations of techniques in action (when possible)

### Avoiding Over-Theorizing

❌ **Too Theoretical:**
"Constructivist learning theory posits that knowledge is constructed through social interaction and prior experience, which informs our approach to facilitation."

✅ **Practical Application:**
"Students learn best when they build on what they already know. That's why we start every class with a quick check-in: 'What do you remember from last week?'"

---

## 5. Inclusion & Cultural Responsiveness

### Representation Matters

**Ensure your content:**
- Uses diverse names in examples (not just "John" and "Sarah")
- Represents varied family structures, cultural backgrounds, and identities
- Avoids stereotypes about students, communities, or teaching contexts
- Acknowledges systemic barriers without deficit framing

**Language to Avoid:**
- "At-risk students" → "Students who have been underserved"
- "Low-performing" → "Developing," "emerging," or be specific about skill gaps
- "Broken homes" → "Varied family structures"
- Assumptions about access to technology, resources, or prior knowledge

### Acknowledge Context

- Teaching contexts vary widely (urban/rural, resource levels, class sizes)
- Provide adaptations: "If you're teaching a large class, try..."
- Normalize challenges: "You might find this difficult at first..."
- Honor instructor expertise: "You know your students best"

---

## 6. Cognitive Load & Accessibility

### Reduce Cognitive Overload

**One Core Idea at a Time**
- Don't introduce multiple concepts simultaneously
- Use transitions: "Now that we've covered X, let's move to Y"
- Repeat key terms and concepts

**Signposting**
- Tell them what you're going to tell them
- Tell them
- Tell them what you told them

**Visual Aids**
- Use diagrams, charts, and graphics to reinforce concepts
- Show don't just tell (screen recordings, demonstrations)
- Keep slides simple (6 words per line, 6 lines per slide max)

### Accessibility

**Visual:**
- High contrast text and backgrounds
- Large, readable fonts (minimum 24pt for on-screen text)
- Don't rely on color alone (use labels, shapes, patterns)

**Audio:**
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace (not too fast)
- Pause between major points
- Provide closed captions (REQUIRED)
- Offer transcripts

**Cognitive:**
- Define jargon when first used
- Provide summaries at logical breakpoints
- Offer optional "deep dive" resources for those who want more

---

## 7. Credibility & Evidence

### When to Cite Research

**Do cite research when:**
- Making claims about what works in education
- Introducing a new framework or model
- Challenging common misconceptions

**How to cite:**
- Keep it brief: "Research shows that..." or "Studies from [Organization] found..."
- Don't need full APA citations in videos (can link in description)
- Use credible sources (peer-reviewed, reputable organizations)

**Balance evidence with experience:**
- "Research shows this approach works, AND here's what it looks like in practice..."

### YPP-Specific References

- Cite the YPP Instructor Playbook when referencing policies
- Reference YPP values and mission when contextualizing practices
- Show alignment with chapter-specific norms (when applicable)

---

## 8. Motivation & Growth Mindset

### Inspire Without Overwhelming

**Acknowledge the Challenge:**
- "This is hard work, and it's okay if it doesn't feel natural right away"
- "Even experienced instructors struggle with this"

**Emphasize Growth:**
- "You'll get better with practice"
- "This is a skill you can develop"
- "Notice your progress over time"

**Connect to Impact:**
- "When you master this, students will..."
- "This directly affects how safe and engaged your students feel"
- "Your growth as an instructor creates opportunities for your students"

### Avoid:
- Perfectionism ("You must always...")
- Guilt or shame ("If you're not doing this, you're failing your students")
- Overwhelm (too many strategies at once)

---

## 9. Call to Action

### Every Video Should End With Clear Next Steps

**Effective CTAs:**
- **Specific:** "Draft your opening script using the template"
- **Actionable:** "Review your lesson plan and add 3 formative checks"
- **Time-bound:** "Before your next class..."
- **Connected:** "This prepares you for Checkpoint 2"

**Examples:**

✅ **Clear CTA:**
"Now it's your turn. Open the Classroom Agreements Template and draft 5 agreements you'll co-create with your students. You'll submit these for Checkpoint 1."

❌ **Vague CTA:**
"Think about classroom culture and how it applies to your context."

## 12. Iteration & Feedback

### How to Improve Over Time

1. **Watch your own videos** - You'll catch things you missed
2. **Get peer feedback** - Have another instructor watch and critique
3. **Review analytics** - Where do viewers drop off?
4. **Read comments/questions** - What are learners confused about?
5. **Update regularly** - Refresh outdated content annually

### Continuous Improvement Mindset

- First videos won't be perfect—that's okay
- Each video is a chance to get better
- Iterate based on data and feedback
- Celebrate progress, not perfection
