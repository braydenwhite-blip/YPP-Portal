# Video Production Guide
## YPP Instructor Academy Training Videos

---

## Overview
This guide provides best practices for recording, editing, and publishing high-quality training videos for the YPP Instructor Academy.

---

## 1. Pre-Production

### Equipment Recommendations

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **Microphone:** USB microphone or laptop built-in (clear audio is critical)
- **Camera:** Webcam or laptop camera (720p minimum, 1080p recommended)
- **Software:**
  - Screen recording: Loom, Zoom, OBS Studio, or QuickTime (Mac)
  - Video editing: iMovie (Mac), DaVinci Resolve (free), Adobe Premiere (paid)
- **Lighting:** Natural window light or ring light
- **Background:** Clean, professional, minimal distractions

**Recommended Upgrades:**
- External USB microphone (Blue Yeti, Audio-Technica ATR2100)
- Ring light or softbox for even lighting
- Green screen (optional, for background replacement)

### Environment Setup

1. **Choose a quiet location** - Minimize background noise
2. **Test audio levels** - Record 30 seconds and listen back
3. **Check lighting** - Face should be well-lit, avoid harsh shadows
4. **Frame yourself** - Head and shoulders visible, looking at camera
5. **Minimize distractions** - Close unnecessary applications, silence notifications

## 2. Recording Best Practices

### Video Types

**Talking Head (Direct to Camera):**
- Use for introductions, explanations, and personal connection
- Look directly at camera (not screen)
- Maintain energy and enthusiasm
- Use hand gestures naturally

**Screen Recording:**
- Use for demonstrations, walkthroughs, and technical content
- Use a high contrast cursor (make it large and visible)
- Move mouse slowly and deliberately
- Zoom in on important areas
- Highlight clicks with annotation tools

**Combination (Picture-in-Picture):**
- Combine talking head with screen recording
- Place webcam video in corner (usually lower right)
- Ensure webcam doesn't obscure important content
- Switch between full screen and PIP as needed

### Recording Tips

1. **Do a test recording first** - Check audio, video, and pacing
2. **Use a script or outline** - Don't wing it, but don't read robotically
3. **Record in chunks** - Break into 5-10 minute segments, easier to edit
4. **Pause between mistakes** - Don't restart, just pause and continue (edit later)
5. **Maintain consistent energy** - Your enthusiasm is contagious
6. **Speak clearly and at moderate pace** - Allow time for processing
7. **Use the "3-second rule"** - Pause 3 seconds before and after each segment for easier editing

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Speaking too fast
- ❌ Using jargon without explanation
- ❌ Long, rambling explanations
- ❌ Poor audio quality (echoes, background noise)
- ❌ Low energy or monotone delivery
- ❌ Not looking at the camera
- ❌ Cluttered screen or background

## 3. Editing

### Basic Editing Workflow

1. **Import footage** - Bring all video clips into editing software
2. **Rough cut** - Remove mistakes, long pauses, and unnecessary content
3. **Add b-roll** - Insert supplementary visuals (examples, diagrams, screen recordings)
4. **Add graphics** - Include title cards, lower thirds, callouts, arrows
5. **Audio enhancement** - Remove background noise, normalize levels, add music (if appropriate)
6. **Color correction** - Adjust brightness, contrast, saturation for consistency
7. **Export** - Render final video in appropriate format

### Editing Tips

- **Keep it tight** - Cut out filler words ("um," "uh," "like")
- **Use jump cuts** - Don't be afraid to cut out pauses and mistakes
- **Add visual interest** - Use text overlays, zoom-ins, and transitions (sparingly)
- **Maintain pacing** - 3-5 second clips keep viewer engaged
- **Add chapter markers** - Help viewers navigate longer videos
- **Test on different devices** - Ensure video and audio quality on mobile and desktop

### Graphics & On-Screen Text

**Title Cards:**
- Module name and number
- Video title
- Segment titles (for longer videos)

**Lower Thirds:**
- Your name and role
- Key terms or concepts

**Callouts:**
- Arrows pointing to important elements
- Highlight boxes around key areas
- Animated circles or underlines for emphasis

**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent branding (YPP colors, fonts)
- Keep text large and readable (test on mobile)
- Use high contrast (dark text on light background or vice versa)
- Limit on-screen text to essential information

## 4. Audio Quality

### Audio is MORE important than video
Viewers will forgive mediocre video quality but will leave if audio is poor.

### Audio Checklist

- [ ] No background noise (fans, traffic, echo)
- [ ] Consistent volume level throughout
- [ ] Clear pronunciation and articulation
- [ ] No clipping or distortion
- [ ] Music (if used) is quiet and non-distracting
- [ ] Voice is centered in stereo field

### Audio Editing

- **Noise reduction** - Remove hums, hisses, and ambient noise
- **Normalization** - Ensure consistent volume (-3dB to -6dB is good target)
- **Compression** - Even out loud and quiet parts
- **EQ** - Enhance clarity (boost mids, reduce lows if needed)
- **Music** - Use royalty-free music at 10-20% volume of voice

**Royalty-Free Music Sources:**
- YouTube Audio Library
- Epidemic Sound
- Artlist
- Free Music Archive

## 5. Accessibility

### Closed Captions (REQUIRED)

All training videos MUST include accurate closed captions.

**Options:**
1. **Auto-generate with editing** - YouTube, Vimeo, and Loom provide auto-captions (review and edit for accuracy)
2. **Manual creation** - Use subtitle editors (Aegisub, Subtitle Edit)
3. **Professional service** - Rev.com, Kapwing (paid)

**Caption Best Practices:**
- 1-2 lines per screen
- 32-42 characters per line
- Sync precisely with spoken words
- Include sound effects in brackets [applause], [music]
- Use proper punctuation and capitalization

### Other Accessibility Considerations

- **Descriptive narration** - Describe visual elements (e.g., "as shown in the diagram on the left...")
- **High contrast** - Text and graphics should be easily readable
- **Avoid relying solely on color** - Use shapes, patterns, or labels in addition to color coding
- **Provide transcripts** - Full text version of video content

## 8. Iteration & Improvement

### Gather Feedback

After publishing, track:
- **View duration** - Are people watching all the way through?
- **Drop-off points** - Where do viewers stop watching?
- **Quiz/assessment scores** - Are learning objectives being met?
- **User comments/questions** - What are common points of confusion?

### Continuous Improvement

- Review analytics monthly
- Update videos when content becomes outdated
- Re-record segments with high drop-off rates
- Incorporate learner feedback
- Test new techniques and formats
