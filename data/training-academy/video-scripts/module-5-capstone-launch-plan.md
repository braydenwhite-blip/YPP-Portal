## FULL VIDEO SCRIPT

### [00:00] HOOK - THE BLUEPRINT TEST

Imagine this: It's the night before your first YPP class. You've watched all the training videos, completed the checkpoints, passed the quizzes. But now you're staring at your lesson plan and thinking: *Is this actually ready? Could I walk into a classroom tomorrow and teach this?*

*[VISUAL: Instructor looking at laptop with lesson plan, uncertain expression]*

That's the question the capstone answers.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

Welcome to the Capstone: Launch-Ready Instructor Plan. This is the final module—the one where everything you've learned comes together into a *usable teaching blueprint*.

You're going to build a complete class plan with objectives, sequence, timing, learner supports, assessments, and communication templates. Then you're going to submit it for review. And when it's approved, you'll know: *Yes. I'm ready.*

This isn't a test. It's your teaching blueprint. Let's build it.

### [02:00] WHAT "LAUNCH-READY" ACTUALLY MEANS

Let's define the bar. What makes a class plan "launch-ready"?

*[VISUAL: Checklist graphic with three criteria]*

A launch-ready plan is:

**1. Objective-Aligned**
Every activity, every assessment, every minute of your class connects back to a clear, measurable learning objective. There's no filler. No random activities because they "sound fun." Everything serves the goal.

**2. Evidence-Based**
Your plan shows *how* you'll know students are learning. You've included formative checks, success criteria, and a rubric. You're not guessing whether students got it—you're measuring it.

**3. Implementation-Ready**
Someone else could pick up your plan and teach the class. The agenda has time stamps. The transitions are scripted. The materials are listed. The supports are designed. It's not a sketch—it's a blueprint.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Objective-aligned, evidence-based, implementation-ready"]*

This is the minimum quality bar for capstone evidence. If your plan is vague, incomplete, or missing key components, it will come back with a revision request. And that's okay—revision is part of the process.

But your goal is to submit something so clear, so complete, that the reviewer says: "Yes, this instructor is ready to launch."

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

### [03:30] CHECKPOINT 1 - THE COMPLETE CLASS PLAN

Let's break down what goes into the complete class plan (Checkpoint 1).

*[VISUAL: Template outline showing all required sections]*

Your class plan must include:

**Section 1: Learning Objective**
Write one measurable objective using this format: "By the end of this class, students will be able to [specific, observable action]."

Example: "Students will create a functional prototype of a mobile app feature using Figma, including at least three interactive screens."

**Section 2: Success Criteria**
What does good work look like? List 3-5 specific criteria.

Example:
- ✅ Prototype includes three linked screens
- ✅ Buttons have working click interactions
- ✅ Design follows basic UX principles (contrast, alignment, spacing)

**Section 3: Full Class Sequence with Timing**
Use the "I Do, We Do, You Do Together, You Do Alone" model. Include time estimates for each phase.

Example:
- 0-5 min: Opening and objective framing
- 5-15 min: Model app prototype creation (I Do)
- 15-25 min: Co-create second screen together (We Do)
- 25-40 min: Partner practice building third screen (You Do Together)
- 40-55 min: Independent work on full prototype (You Do Alone)
- 55-60 min: Closure and reflection

**Section 4: Materials and Resources**
List everything students and you will need. Figma templates, tutorial links, example prototypes, rubric handouts.

**Section 5: Formative Checks**
Where will you check for understanding? What will you do if students are confused?

Example: "At minute 25, thumbs check on confidence. If >50% thumbs down, reteach screen linking before moving to independent work."

*[VISUAL: All five sections listed on screen]*

This is your core teaching document. It's what you'll actually use in class. Treat it like a professional blueprint.

### [05:00] CHECKPOINT 2 - LEARNER SUPPORT STRATEGY

Now let's talk about differentiation (Checkpoint 2).

Your class will have students at different skill levels. Some will breeze through. Some will struggle. Your job is to plan for both *before* class starts.

*[VISUAL: Two-column chart - "Support for Struggling Learners" and "Extension for Advanced Learners"]*

**Support for Struggling Learners:**

Identify the most likely points of confusion. Then design a scaffold.

Example: "Students who struggle with screen linking can use the pre-built template with placeholder screens already set up. They focus on customizing content rather than building structure from scratch."

Include:
- Simplified templates
- Step-by-step checklists
- Sentence stems or visual guides
- Option for one-on-one check-in

**Extension for Advanced Learners:**

Design a task that deepens mastery without just adding busywork.

Example: "Students who finish early add a fifth screen with an animated transition and submit a 2-minute screen recording explaining their design choices."

Include:
- Additional complexity tied to the objective
- Reflection or critique component
- Peer support role (helping others after completing their own work)

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Plan for all learners, not just the middle"]*

Reviewers will look for this. If your plan only works for students who already know the material, it's not launch-ready.

---

### [06:30] CHECKPOINT 3 - ASSESSMENT AND RUBRIC

Here's where you show how you'll measure success (Checkpoint 3).

*[VISUAL: Rubric template with criteria and performance levels]*

You need two types of assessment:

**Formative Assessment (During Class):**
These are your real-time checks. Thumbs checks, exit tickets, quick conferences, show-me-your-screen moments. You already planned these in Checkpoint 1—now make sure they're specific.

Example: "Minute 40 exit ticket: Students screenshot their prototype and type one challenge they faced. I read these during the last 5 minutes and adjust tomorrow's opener based on patterns."

**Summative Assessment (End of Unit/Project):**
This is the final evaluation. It should align *exactly* with your success criteria.

Build a simple rubric with 3-4 criteria. For each criterion, define what "meets expectations" looks like.

Example rubric for app prototype project:

| Criterion | Meets Expectation | Needs Revision |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| Screen Count & Linking | 3+ screens, all linked | Fewer than 3 screens or broken links |
| Interactivity | Buttons have working click states | Buttons are static/non-functional |
| UX Principles | Clear visual hierarchy and spacing | Cluttered or hard to navigate |
| Reflection | Explains 2+ design choices clearly | Vague or missing explanation |

*[VISUAL: Full rubric shown on screen]*

Your rubric should be *student-facing*. They should be able to self-assess using it during work time. That's how rubrics drive learning, not just scoring.

---

### [08:00] CHECKPOINT 4 - COMMUNICATION TEMPLATE

Let's talk about something often overlooked: communication (Checkpoint 4).

Before your class starts, you need to set expectations with students and, if applicable, their families.

*[VISUAL: Email template on screen]*

Draft a communication template that includes:

**1. Welcome and Context**
"Welcome to Game Design 101! Over the next eight weeks, you'll learn to design and prototype your own video game using industry-standard tools."

**2. Learning Goals**
"By the end of this course, you'll be able to create a playable game prototype, develop characters and narratives, and give/receive design feedback."

**3. Participation Expectations**
"You'll need to attend at least 7 of 8 sessions, complete weekly design challenges, and participate in peer critique sessions."

**4. Materials Needed**
"You'll need a laptop and a free account on [platform]. We'll set this up in week one."

**5. How to Get Help**
"If you're stuck, you can message me on Slack, come to office hours Wednesdays 4-5pm, or ask a classmate during collaboration time."

**6. Contact Info and Key Dates**
Your email, the class schedule, important deadlines.

*[VISUAL: All six sections highlighted in the template]*

This template does two things:
1. It sets clear expectations so students aren't confused on day one.
2. It shows reviewers that you've thought about the full student experience—not just what happens in the classroom.

You'll customize this for your specific class, but the structure stays the same.

### [09:00] CHECKPOINT 5 - SELF-AUDIT CHECKLIST

Okay, here's the last checkpoint before submission: the self-audit (Checkpoint 5).

*[VISUAL: Checklist graphic]*

Before you submit your capstone, run it through this launch-readiness checklist:

**✅ Objective Check:**
Is my learning objective specific, measurable, and achievable in the time I have?

**✅ Alignment Check:**
Does every activity connect back to the objective? Is there any filler I should cut?

**✅ Timing Check:**
Do my time estimates add up to the full class period? Have I left buffer time for transitions and questions?

**✅ Differentiation Check:**
Have I planned supports for struggling learners *and* extensions for advanced learners?

**✅ Assessment Check:**
Do I have formative checks built in? Is my rubric aligned to my success criteria?

**✅ Materials Check:**
Have I listed every resource, link, and handout students will need? Can I access them all right now?

**✅ Risk Check:**
What could go wrong? Tech failure? Students finish too quickly? Confusion on a key concept? Have I planned mitigation strategies?

*[VISUAL: Full checklist on screen]*

That last one—risk check—is crucial. Reviewers want to see that you've thought about failure modes and have backup plans.

Example: "Risk: Figma goes down mid-class. Mitigation: I'll have a downloadable backup template students can work on locally, and we'll upload when the site comes back."

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

If you can check every box and annotate your risks with mitigation strategies, your plan is launch-ready.

---

### [09:45] THE REVIEW PROCESS - WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

Let's talk about what happens after you submit.

*[VISUAL: Review workflow diagram - Submit → Review → Approve or Revise]*

Your capstone evidence will be reviewed by a YPP chapter lead or experienced instructor. They're looking for three things:

**1. Completeness**
Did you include all five checkpoints? Is anything missing or vague?

**2. Quality**
Is this plan actually usable? Could someone teach from it tomorrow?

**3. Alignment**
Does your plan reflect YPP pedagogy? Facilitation stance, student agency, formative feedback, equity design?

*[VISUAL: Three review criteria shown]*

You'll get one of two outcomes:

**Approved:**
Your evidence is complete and launch-ready. You move forward to the interview readiness gate. Congrats!

**Revision Requested:**
The reviewer identified gaps or areas that need strengthening. You'll get specific feedback (using the same strength-gap-next-step formula you learned in Module 4). You revise and resubmit.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Revision is not failure—it's refinement"]*

Most first submissions get at least minor revision requests. That's normal. The goal isn't perfection on draft one. The goal is a launch-ready plan by the final draft.

When you resubmit, include a brief note: "Changes made: Added formative check at minute 25, revised rubric to include reflection criterion, added tech failure mitigation plan." This helps the reviewer see your responsiveness.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

---

### [10:30] CLOSE - THIS IS YOUR TEACHING FOUNDATION

Here's what the capstone really is: It's proof that you can take everything you've learned—facilitation stance, classroom culture, lesson design, feedback systems—and turn it into a real, teachable class.

*[VISUAL: Instructor confidently walking into classroom with plan in hand]*

This isn't about impressing a reviewer. This is about building confidence in yourself.

When you walk into your first YPP class, you won't be winging it. You'll have a plan that's been reviewed, refined, and validated. You'll know your objective. You'll know your sequence. You'll know your supports and your assessments.

And when something goes wrong—because something always goes wrong—you'll have the foundation to adjust.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Your capstone is your confidence"]*

So take your time with this. Use the templates. Run the self-audit. Ask questions if you're stuck. And when you submit, know that you're not just completing a requirement—you're building the blueprint for your teaching.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

After capstone approval, you'll move to the interview readiness gate. And after that? You'll be a certified YPP Level 101 instructor, ready to change students' lives through project-based learning.

You've come a long way. Now finish strong.

Go build that plan. You've got this.
