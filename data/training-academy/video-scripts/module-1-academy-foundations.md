## FULL VIDEO SCRIPT

### [00:00] HOOK - The First 90 Seconds

Picture this: It's your first day as a YPP instructor. Fifteen middle schoolers are staring at you. One kid has earbuds in. Two are already on their phones. Someone in the back asks, "What are we even doing today?"

You have about ninety seconds to answer that question—not just with words, but with your entire presence, your structure, and your promise of what this class will be.

*[VISUAL: Split screen - chaotic classroom on left, calm structured classroom on right]*

Welcome to Academy Foundations. I'm here to give you the YPP instructor playbook—the non-negotiables, the facilitation stance that makes our model work, and the specific moves that turn that chaotic first moment into a powerful learning launch.

By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to open your first class, what our three core safety norms are, and why the first ten minutes determine everything that comes after.

Let's get started.

### [02:00] THE YPP TEACHING STANCE

Here's the thing: YPP is not a lecture model. You are not a sage on a stage. You're a *facilitation guide*—someone who structures the space, asks the right questions, and holds students accountable to their own growth.

*[VISUAL: Diagram showing "Traditional Teacher" vs "YPP Facilitator"]*

What does that actually mean? It means three things:

**First**, you guide with prompts and checkpoints, not by telling students every answer. Your job is to design the conditions for discovery—not to deliver all the content yourself.

**Second**, you keep accountability. Just because students have agency doesn't mean it's a free-for-all. You track progress. You follow up. You redirect when needed. Structure and student voice aren't opposites—they're partners.

**Third**, you respond in real time. If your check-in shows 60% of the class is confused, you don't barrel ahead. You reteach, you adjust, you meet them where they are.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

This stance is the foundation of everything else we'll cover. If you try to lecture for 45 minutes, our curriculum won't work. If you give total freedom without checkpoints, learning falls apart. The YPP model lives in the balance.

*[VISUAL: Text overlay - "Guide. Hold accountable. Respond."]*

### [04:00] THE THREE NON-NEGOTIABLE NORMS

Now let's talk safety. Every YPP classroom must establish three core norms in the first session. These aren't suggestions—they're requirements.

**Norm One: Respectful Space.**
Every student has the right to learn without being mocked, interrupted, or dismissed. This means we use kind language, we listen when others speak, and we assume good intent. If someone makes a mistake, we support—we don't tear down.

**Norm Two: Growth Mindset.**
In YPP, struggle is not failure—it's the process. We celebrate attempts, we normalize revision, and we reject fixed labels like "I'm just not a math person." Everyone in this room is capable of growth. Period.

**Norm Three: Opt-Out Protocols.**
Students can pass on sharing, take a break if overwhelmed, or request private check-ins. Agency includes the right to not perform on demand. We balance this with accountability—opting out of a share is fine, but opting out of the work itself is not.

*[VISUAL: Slide showing all three norms as a list]*

You'll notice these norms set high expectations *and* provide psychological safety. That's intentional. We're not lowering the bar—we're building the conditions where all students can meet it.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "High expectations + High support = YPP culture"]*

### [06:00] WHY THE FIRST 10 MINUTES MATTER

Let me tell you what happens when you nail the first ten minutes: Students know what they're doing, why it matters, and how to succeed. Confusion drops. Engagement rises. You spend less time managing and more time teaching.

*[VISUAL: Clock graphic showing 10-minute breakdown]*

Here's the research-backed structure:

**Minutes 0-2: Anchor with clarity.**
State the objective in student-friendly language. Not "SWBAT analyze persuasive techniques"—say "By the end of today, you'll be able to spot three tricks advertisers use to make you buy things." Then name the success criteria: "You'll know you've got it when you can find all three in a real ad."

**Minutes 2-5: Set norms and tone.**
Reinforce participation expectations. Remind students how to ask for help, how to use materials, what to do if they finish early. This isn't boring logistics—it's removing barriers before they appear.

**Minutes 5-8: Hook with relevance.**
Show a compelling example, pose a provocative question, or activate prior knowledge. "Have you ever bought something you didn't need because of an ad? Let's figure out how they got you."

**Minutes 8-10: Launch into guided practice.**
Start with a low-risk entry task where everyone can succeed. This builds momentum and gives you immediate feedback on who's ready and who needs support.

*[VISUAL: Timeline graphic with each phase labeled]*

If you skip this structure and just dive into content, you lose kids in minute three. The first ten minutes are your investment in the next fifty.

### [08:00] CRAFTING YOUR OPENING SCRIPT

Let's make this concrete. One of your checkpoints is to write a 60-second opening script that sets goals, norms, and tone. Here's what a strong one sounds like:

*[SPEAK WITH ENERGY, AS IF TO A CLASS]*

> "Good morning, everyone! Welcome to Game Design 101. Today's goal is simple: you're going to learn how to create a character that players actually care about. By the end of class, you'll have designed one character with a backstory, a motivation, and a weakness.
>
> Here's how we'll work: I'll model an example, we'll try one together, then you'll create your own. If you get stuck, flag me down or ask a neighbor—collaboration is encouraged.
>
> One reminder: in this space, every idea is worth exploring. Weird is good. There are no bad first drafts. Let's build something cool.
>
> Laptops open, character design doc pulled up—let's go."

*[VISUAL: Text of script on screen with annotations pointing to: Objective, Success criteria, Norms, Tone]*

Notice what that script does:
✅ States the objective in plain language
✅ Explains the success outcome
✅ Describes the structure (I do, we do, you do)
✅ Sets a collaborative, creative tone
✅ Ends with a clear action step

Now compare that to a weak opening:

> "Okay, um, so today we're doing characters. Just, like, make a character. I'll be around if you need help. Go ahead and start."

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

What's missing? Clarity. Direction. Energy. Students don't know what success looks like, how to ask for help, or why this matters. You've lost the room before you started.

*[VISUAL: Red X over weak example, green check over strong example]*

Your job in Checkpoint 2 is to write your own 60-second script and practice it out loud until it feels natural. This isn't theater—it's teaching. But words matter.

### [10:00] STUDENT CHECK-IN PROMPTS

Here's a move that separates great YPP instructors from average ones: *frequent, low-stakes check-ins*.

Every 10-15 minutes, you need to pulse-check the room. Are students confused? Confident? Ready to move on? If you don't ask, you're flying blind.

*[VISUAL: Examples of check-in methods - thumbs up/down, fist to five, exit ticket]*

Checkpoint 4 asks you to create five high-quality check-in prompts. Here are examples:

1. **Confidence check**: "Fist to five—how confident are you that you could explain this concept to a classmate right now?"
2. **Completion check**: "Thumbs up if you've finished step three. Sideways thumb if you're still working. Down if you're stuck."
3. **Concept check**: "In the chat, type one word that describes the main character's motivation."
4. **Pacing check**: "Raise your hand if you need five more minutes before we move on."
5. **Reflection check**: "On a scale of 1-10, how useful was today's class? Be honest—I want to improve."

*[VISUAL: All five prompts listed on screen]*

The key is to make these quick, specific, and actionable. Vague check-ins like "Everyone good?" don't give you data. Specific prompts do.

And here's the crucial part: *you have to respond to what you learn*. If eight students are stuck, you can't just keep going. You adjust. That's the facilitation stance in action.

### [12:00] BALANCING STRUCTURE AND STUDENT VOICE

Let's address a tension you'll feel: How much structure is too much? How much freedom is too little?

*[VISUAL: Balance scale with "Structure" on one side, "Student Voice" on other]*

Here's the YPP answer: You provide *tight structure around process*, but *wide latitude around product*.

What does that mean?

**Tight structure around process:**
- Clear objectives
- Defined checkpoints
- Non-negotiable deadlines
- Required feedback cycles

**Wide latitude around product:**
- Students choose their project topics
- They pick their creative approach
- They define what "excellent" looks like for their work
- They solve problems their own way

Think of it like jazz: You set the key, the tempo, the core progression—but students improvise the melody.

*[VISUAL: Jazz band metaphor graphic]*

Checkpoint 5 asks you to reflect on your facilitation stance. Here's a guiding question: When a student asks, "Can I do it this way instead?"—what's your instinct?

If your first thought is "No, follow the instructions," you might be over-structuring. If your first thought is "Sure, do whatever," you might be under-structuring.

The YPP answer is usually: *"Tell me how your approach meets the objective, and let's decide together."*

That's the balance. You're not a drill sergeant. You're not a pushover. You're a guide with standards.

### [14:00] APPLICATION BRIDGE - FROM VIDEO TO CHECKPOINTS

Alright, let's bring this home. You've got five checkpoints to complete after this video. Here's how they all connect:

*[VISUAL: Flowchart showing how checkpoints build on each other]*

**Checkpoint 1** is your foundation—read the full instructor playbook and identify the three non-negotiable norms we just covered.

**Checkpoint 2** asks you to write that 60-second opening script. Use the strong example I modeled as a template.

**Checkpoint 3** wants a minute-by-minute plan for your first ten minutes. Use the 0-2-5-8-10 structure we walked through.

**Checkpoint 4** is about creating those five check-in prompts. Make them specific, actionable, and tied to real decision points in your lesson.

**Checkpoint 5** is your reflection on facilitation stance. Be honest about where you fall on the structure-versus-voice spectrum, and think about how YPP's model might stretch you.

These aren't busywork. These are the artifacts you'll actually use in your first class. Treat them like blueprints, not homework.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

### [14:30] CLOSE - YOUR NEXT MOVE

Here's the truth: Teaching is hard. YPP teaching—where you're facilitating agency, tracking twenty different projects, and holding high expectations all at once—is even harder.

But it's also the most rewarding work you'll ever do. Because when a student who thought they "weren't creative" builds something they're proud of? That's not just a good class. That's a life shift.

*[VISUAL: Student testimonial clip or quote on screen]*

You're not going to be perfect on day one. You'll stumble over your opening script. You'll miss a check-in signal. You'll over-structure or under-structure. That's fine. YPP instructors are learners too.

What matters is that you commit to the stance: Guide with prompts. Hold accountability. Respond in real time.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Guide. Hold accountable. Respond."]*

Now go complete those checkpoints. Start with the playbook review—it's your north star. Then write that opening script and say it out loud ten times until it feels like you.

You've got this. Welcome to YPP.

## ON-SCREEN TEXT RECOMMENDATIONS
1. "Guide. Hold accountable. Respond." (appears at 02:45 and 14:45)
2. "High expectations + High support = YPP culture" (appears at 05:30)
3. "The first 10 minutes determine the next 50" (appears at 07:00)
4. Three non-negotiable norms list (appears at 04:30)
5. "You're not a lecturer. You're a facilitation guide." (appears at 02:15)

## B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS
1. Real YPP classroom - instructor guiding small groups (use during 02:00-04:00)
2. Students collaborating on a project, instructor circulating (use during 06:00-08:00)
3. Instructor modeling think-aloud at document camera (use during 08:00-10:00)
4. Close-up of student check-in via thumbs/fist-to-five (use during 10:00-12:00)
5. Student presenting project confidently (use during 14:30 close)
6. Instructor writing on whiteboard with clear agenda (use during first 10 minutes section)
7. Diverse students engaged, some working alone, some in pairs (use throughout)

## ACCESSIBILITY NOTES
- When showing the weak vs. strong script comparison (08:00), ensure both scripts are read aloud in full, not just shown on screen
- The balance scale visual at 12:00 should be described verbally: "Imagine a balance scale with structure on one side and student voice on the other"
- All on-screen text should remain visible for minimum 5 seconds
- The 10-minute breakdown graphic should be accompanied by the verbal walkthrough (already included in script)

## PACING NOTES
- Total word count: ~2,100 words
- Average speaking pace: 140 words/minute = 15 minutes
- Sections marked [PAUSE 2 SEC] are built into timing
- The script example at 08:00 should be delivered with energy but not rushed
- The close (14:30-15:00) should slow down slightly for emphasis—this is motivational, not informational
