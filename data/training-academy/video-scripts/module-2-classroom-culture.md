## FULL VIDEO SCRIPT

### [00:00] HOOK - The Interruption Crisis

It's week three. Your class has been going pretty well—until today. Two students start talking over each other during a group discussion. It escalates. One raises their voice. The other rolls their eyes and crosses their arms. The whole room goes quiet, watching to see what you'll do.

*[VISUAL: Classroom scene - two students in conflict, others watching]*

You have about ten seconds to respond. What you do next will either restore the culture you've been building—or crack it wide open.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

Welcome to Classroom Culture and Student Support. This module is about building spaces where students feel safe enough to take risks *and* challenged enough to grow. We're going to talk about classroom agreements, redirection strategies, intervention ladders, and how to handle the scenarios that keep new instructors up at night.

By the end, you'll have a toolkit for preventing disruption, responding to it when it happens, and knowing when to escalate.

Let's go.

### [02:00] AGREEMENTS, NOT RULES

First, let's talk about how we set expectations. In YPP, we don't post a list of "Classroom Rules" on the wall. We co-create *classroom agreements*—and the difference matters.

*[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison - "Rules" list vs "Agreements" list]*

**Rules** are top-down. They're things the teacher imposes. "No talking." "Raise your hand." "No phones." Students follow them—or break them—but they don't own them.

**Agreements** are collaborative. They're norms the class builds together, and everyone—including you—is accountable to them.

Here's the structure for Checkpoint 1: Draft five classroom agreements students can understand and follow.

*[VISUAL: Slide showing the five-agreement template]*

Here's an example set:

1. **We listen when others speak** - This means phones away, eyes on the speaker, no interrupting.
2. **We ask for help when we need it** - Struggling is normal. Staying stuck in silence is not.
3. **We take care of our space** - Clean up materials, respect shared tools, leave the room better than we found it.
4. **We support each other's growth** - Celebrate wins, help each other through challenges, no mocking mistakes.
5. **We give our best effort** - Not perfection—*effort*. Show up, try hard, and be honest when you need a break.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Agreements are co-created, not imposed"]*

Notice these are written in first-person plural: "We." Not "You will" or "Students must." That's intentional. You're part of the agreement too.

And here's the key: You introduce these on day one, you *reinforce them every single class*, and when someone violates an agreement, you reference it by name. "Remember our agreement about listening when others speak? Let's reset."

Culture isn't built in one lesson. It's built in a hundred small moments of consistency.

### [04:00] THE INTERVENTION LADDER

Now let's talk about what happens when students go off-task. Because they will. It's not a question of *if*—it's a question of *how you respond*.

*[VISUAL: Ladder graphic with three rungs labeled]*

The intervention ladder is a three-step escalation model. You start at the bottom and only move up if the behavior continues.

**Step 1: Proximity and Non-Verbal Redirect**
You're teaching. A student starts scrolling on their phone. You don't stop the lesson—you just walk closer to them while continuing to talk. Make eye contact. Pause near their desk. 80% of the time, proximity alone solves it. No words needed.

**Step 2: Private Verbal Redirect**
The behavior continues. Now you use a calm, specific, private redirect. Lean in close and say quietly: "I need you to put the phone away and rejoin the coding task. Can you do that?" Not a question about whether they will—assume compliance and move on.

**Step 3: Consequence with Follow-Up**
The behavior persists. Now there's a consequence. "This is the third redirect. You'll need to step into the hallway for a reset conversation." You don't argue in front of the class. You deliver the consequence calmly and continue teaching. The follow-up happens privately.

*[VISUAL: Ladder showing all three steps with examples]*

The ladder keeps you from going nuclear too fast. You don't jump to Step 3 for a first offense. But you also don't get stuck at Step 1 forever. If proximity isn't working, escalate.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

Your Checkpoint 3 asks you to build your own intervention ladder. Use this three-step model as a starting point, but customize it for your context. What does a "reset conversation" look like in your classroom? What's the consequence at Step 3? Be specific.

---

### [06:00] REDIRECTION LANGUAGE THAT WORKS

Let's get tactical. Checkpoint 2 asks you to prepare eight redirection statements that are specific, calm, and actionable. Here's why that matters.

*[VISUAL: Two speech bubbles - one labeled "Vague redirect," one labeled "Specific redirect"]*

**Vague redirect:** "Stop messing around."
**Specific redirect:** "I need you to close the side tabs and focus on the design document."

See the difference? Vague redirects don't tell students what to do—they just tell them to stop what they're doing. That creates confusion and often defensiveness.

Specific redirects are behavioral and actionable. They name the exact action you want to see.

*[SPEAK SLOWLY, AS IF DEMONSTRATING IN A CLASSROOM]*

Here are eight examples you can adapt:

1. "I need you to turn your body toward the speaker right now."
2. "Open your project file and start on problem three."
3. "Lower your voice to a whisper, please—this is independent work time."
4. "Eyes on the board for the next two minutes while I explain this step."
5. "I see you're off-task. Rejoin the group discussion within the next thirty seconds."
6. "Put the phone in your pocket or on my desk—you choose."
7. "You've got two options: finish this checkpoint now or stay five minutes after class to complete it."
8. "Take a breath, step outside for one minute if you need to reset, then come back ready."

*[VISUAL: All eight statements listed on screen]*

Notice these are all calm, clear, and time-bound. You're not yelling. You're not pleading. You're stating an expectation and assuming it will be met.

And here's a pro move: After you redirect, *immediately re-engage the student in the work*. Don't let the redirect become the focus. Redirect, pivot, move on. "Thanks—now what's your hypothesis for question two?"

That's how you keep the culture strong without making every correction a power struggle.

### [08:00] RESPONDING TO THE SHUTDOWN STUDENT

Let's talk about a scenario that's trickier than defiance: the student who shuts down.

*[VISUAL: Image of student with head down on desk, disengaged]*

They're not disrupting. They're not arguing. They're just... gone. Head down, blank screen, arms crossed. Maybe they're frustrated. Maybe they're overwhelmed. Maybe something happened before they walked into your class.

Here's what doesn't work: Ignoring it. Calling them out publicly. Forcing them to perform.

Here's what does work: A brief private check-in and a smaller re-entry task.

*[SPEAK WITH WARMTH, AS IF TO A STUDENT]*

You walk over quietly and say:

> "Hey—I noticed you're stuck. What's going on?"
> (Listen to their response, even if it's just a shrug.)
> "Okay, here's what I'm thinking. Forget the full design for now. Just write down one idea for your character's name. That's it. Can you do that in the next two minutes?"

*[VISUAL: Teacher kneeling next to student desk, one-on-one conversation]*

You've done three things:
1. Acknowledged the struggle without judgment.
2. Reduced the task to something achievable.
3. Gave a clear, small next step.

This is the YPP equity lens in action. High expectations don't mean rigidity. They mean meeting students where they are and scaffolding them forward.

If the student re-engages, you build from there. If they don't, that might be a sign something bigger is going on—and that's when you involve your chapter lead or follow the safeguarding protocol.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Private support + achievable entry points = trust"]*

Which brings us to escalation.

### [10:00] WHEN TO ESCALATE

You're an instructor, not a therapist. You're not equipped to handle every crisis, and you're not supposed to be. So when do you escalate to your chapter lead or admin?

*[VISUAL: Flowchart showing escalation decision tree]*

Here's the YPP protocol:

**Escalate immediately if:**
- There's a safety risk (threats, self-harm language, physical altercation)
- A student discloses abuse, neglect, or harm
- A student is under the influence of drugs or alcohol
- There's a Title IX concern (harassment, discrimination, sexual misconduct)

**Escalate after pattern if:**
- A student has missed three consecutive classes without communication
- Repeated serious disruption continues despite your intervention ladder
- A student's performance drops dramatically and suddenly
- You sense something is deeply wrong but can't pinpoint it

**Don't escalate if:**
- A student makes a single minor mistake
- A student is having an off day but is responsive to support
- You're frustrated but the student is not in danger

*[VISUAL: Three categories shown as a list]*

Your Checkpoint 5 asks you to review and acknowledge your chapter's escalation and safeguarding protocol. This isn't optional. You need to know who to contact, how to report, and what documentation to keep.

Culture means creating safety—and sometimes that means knowing when something is beyond your scope.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

### [11:00] MONITORING PARTICIPATION EQUITY

Let's talk about a subtler culture issue: Who gets to speak in your classroom?

*[VISUAL: Bar chart showing unequal participation - a few students with high bars, many with low bars]*

In many classrooms, three to five students dominate every discussion. They're loud, confident, and fast. Everyone else learns to stay quiet. And unless you actively intervene, that pattern reinforces itself week after week.

Checkpoint 4 asks you to map out how you'll monitor participation equity. Here are five strategies:

**1. Talk-time tracker**
Keep a simple seating chart. Make a tick mark every time a student speaks. At the end of class, look at the pattern. If the same five kids have all the marks, adjust.

**2. Cold call with support**
Don't only call on raised hands. Use a randomizer or equity sticks to call on everyone. But pair it with scaffolds: "Take thirty seconds to think, then I'll call on someone."

**3. Turn-and-talk protocols**
Before whole-group discussion, have students turn to a partner and share their idea. Now everyone has practiced their thinking in a low-stakes setting.

**4. Written responses first**
Use a chat box, sticky notes, or a shared doc. Students write their answer before anyone speaks aloud. This prevents the fastest thinker from dominating.

**5. Role-based collaboration**
In group work, assign roles: facilitator, recorder, timekeeper, presenter. Rotate these roles every project so the same student isn't always in charge.

*[VISUAL: All five strategies listed on screen]*

Equity monitoring is not about forcing shy students to perform. It's about designing systems where *everyone* has access to participation—and everyone is accountable for contributing.

When one student dominates group work, the answer isn't to ban group work. The answer is role-based collaboration with rotating responsibilities. That's how you build equity into the structure.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Equity is designed, not accidental"]*

### [12:00] THE CULTURE INDICATOR YOU SHOULD WATCH

Here's how you know if your culture routines are actually working.

It's not that your class is silent. It's not that no one ever makes a mistake. It's this:

*Students can self-correct quickly with minimal prompting.*

*[VISUAL: Student noticing their own behavior and adjusting without teacher intervention]*

You see a student start to interrupt, catch themselves, and stop. You see a student realize they're off-task and refocus without you saying a word. You see a group notice they're excluding someone and adjust their collaboration.

That's internalized culture. That's when the agreements stop being rules you enforce and become norms the class owns.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

You won't get there in week one. But by week four or five, if you've been consistent with your redirects, your check-ins, and your reinforcement of agreements, you'll start to see it.

And when you do, that's when the magic happens. Because you're not spending your energy on management—you're spending it on learning.

### [13:00] APPLICATION BRIDGE - FROM VIDEO TO CHECKPOINTS

Alright, let's connect this to your five checkpoints.

*[VISUAL: Flowchart showing how checkpoints build on each other]*

**Checkpoint 1** asks you to define five classroom agreements. Use the "We" framing. Make them specific and observable. Test them against this question: "Could a student explain this agreement to a new classmate?"

**Checkpoint 2** is your redirection language bank. Write eight specific, calm, actionable redirects. Practice saying them out loud until they don't feel scripted.

**Checkpoint 3** is the intervention ladder. Start with the three-step model I showed you, then customize Step 3 for your context. What's the reset conversation? What's the consequence?

**Checkpoint 4** is your equity monitoring plan. Choose at least two strategies from the list and describe exactly how you'll implement them. "I will use a talk-time tracker" is not enough—explain what the tracker looks like and what you'll do with the data.

**Checkpoint 5** is the protocol review. Read your chapter's escalation guidelines. Know the names and contact info for your chapter lead and safeguarding officer. Acknowledge that you understand when and how to escalate.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

These checkpoints are preparing you for the hardest parts of teaching: the moments when culture wobbles and you have to reset it. Do them seriously. You'll use them in week one.

### [13:30] CLOSE - THE BOTH/AND OF CULTURE

Here's the tension you'll feel as a YPP instructor: You want to be warm and supportive. But you also need to hold high expectations.

And new teachers often think those are opposites. They're not.

*[VISUAL: Venn diagram - "High support" and "High expectations" overlapping in the middle labeled "YPP Culture"]*

The best YPP classrooms are both. They're places where students feel seen, heard, and supported—*and* where showing up late three times in a row has a consequence. Where mistakes are normalized—*and* where revision is required, not optional.

You don't have to choose between being kind and being consistent. You have to be both.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Consistent, specific, and respectful in every correction"]*

When you redirect a student, you do it calmly and respectfully. When you escalate a concern, you do it because you care about the student's wellbeing. When you hold a boundary, you explain why it matters.

That's how you build a culture where students feel safe enough to take risks—and challenged enough to grow.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

Now go write those agreements. Draft those redirects. Build that intervention ladder. Because culture doesn't happen by accident. It's designed, practiced, and reinforced—one interaction at a time.

You've got this.

## ACCESSIBILITY NOTES
- The intervention ladder graphic at 04:00 should be described verbally (already included in script)
- When showing vague vs. specific redirect comparison (06:00), both versions must be read aloud
- The escalation flowchart at 10:00 should have all three categories read aloud with examples
- The Venn diagram at 13:30 should be described: "Imagine two overlapping circles—one labeled high support, one labeled high expectations, and the overlap is YPP culture"

## PACING NOTES
- Total word count: ~1,950 words
- Average speaking pace: 140 words/minute = 13.9 minutes
- The redirection examples at 06:00 should be delivered in a calm, measured tone—model the tone you want instructors to use
- The shutdown student scenario at 08:00 should slow down and feel warm—this is relationship-building, not procedure
- The close (13:30-14:00) should have a steady, confident pace—this is encouragement
