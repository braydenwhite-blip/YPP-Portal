## FULL VIDEO SCRIPT

### [00:00] HOOK - The Useless Feedback

A student submits their first draft. You spend twenty minutes reading it, marking errors, and writing comments. You hand it back with "Good job!" at the top and twelve circled grammar mistakes.

The student looks at it for ten seconds, sees the sea of red marks, and shoves it in their backpack. They don't revise. They don't improve. Your twenty minutes changed nothing.

*[VISUAL: Student paper covered in red marks, student looking defeated]*

Here's why: That wasn't feedback. It was correction. And correction without direction doesn't lead to growth—it leads to discouragement.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

Welcome to Assessment, Feedback, and Learner Growth. This module is about giving feedback that students can actually *use*—specific, evidence-based, and actionable. We're going to talk about the difference between grading and feedback, how to design revision loops that work, and how to track growth over time instead of just measuring performance in a single moment.

By the end, you'll know how to give feedback that drives improvement, not just documentation.

Let's fix that red-pen problem.

### [02:00] FEEDBACK VS. GRADING - THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THING

First, we need to separate two things that teachers often conflate: *feedback* and *grading*.

*[VISUAL: Two-column chart - "Feedback" vs. "Grading"]*

**Grading** is summative. It's a final evaluation. It says "Here's how good your work is right now." It's backward-looking. A grade is a score: 87%, B+, 4 out of 5.

**Feedback** is formative. It's guidance for improvement. It says "Here's what you should do next to get better." It's forward-looking. Feedback is direction: "Add evidence to paragraph two," "Clarify your thesis," "Revise this section."

In YPP, we prioritize feedback over grading—especially early in the learning process. Because grades close the loop. Feedback keeps it open.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Grading = backward. Feedback = forward."]*

Here's a practical example. A student writes a persuasive essay.

**Grading approach:**
You read it, circle errors, write "Needs work" at the top, and give it a C. The student reads "C" and stops engaging. What are they supposed to do with "Needs work"?

**Feedback approach:**
You write: "Your claim in paragraph one is strong. Now add one piece of data to support it in paragraph two—a statistic, a quote, or an example. Once you do that, your argument will be much more convincing."

The student knows *exactly* what to do next. That's actionable.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

Checkpoint 1 asks you to define four clear criteria aligned to your class objective. These criteria become the basis for feedback—not grades. When you tell a student "You've met criterion one, but criterion three needs work," they know where to focus revision.

### [04:00] THE EVIDENCE-BASED FEEDBACK FORMULA

Let's talk about how to structure feedback so it's specific and actionable. Here's the formula:

*[VISUAL: Three-part formula - Strength + Gap + Next Step]*

**1. Name a Strength (Tied to Evidence)**
Don't say "Good job." Say: "Your opening hook—the statistic about social media use—immediately grabbed my attention. That's effective."

**2. Identify the Gap (Specific)**
Don't say "Your argument is weak." Say: "Paragraph two makes a claim but doesn't back it up with evidence."

**3. Give a Concrete Next Step**
Don't say "Add more detail." Say: "Find one statistic or expert quote to support your claim in paragraph two. Cite it properly and explain how it strengthens your point."

*[VISUAL: All three parts shown with examples]*

Notice what this formula does:
✅ It starts positive (students stay engaged).
✅ It's specific (no guessing what you mean).
✅ It's achievable (one concrete next step, not ten).

Checkpoint 2 asks you to draft ten feedback stems using specific evidence language. Here are five examples to get you started:

1. "Your [specific element] is strong because [evidence]. Now strengthen [specific area] by [concrete action]."
2. "I see you've [specific achievement]. Next, focus on [one gap] by [specific revision step]."
3. "This section works well: [quote specific part]. Revise this section: [quote specific part]. Try [specific strategy]."
4. "You've met the success criterion for [criterion name]. To improve [different criterion], [specific next step]."
5. "Your [strength] shows growth from last time. Now tackle [one specific gap] using [tool or strategy]."

*[VISUAL: All five stems listed on screen]*

Practice writing these until they feel natural. The more specific you are, the more likely students will act on your feedback.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Strength + Gap + Next Step = Actionable Feedback"]*

### [06:00] THE REVISION LOOP - TURNING FEEDBACK INTO GROWTH

Here's the problem with one-and-done assignments: A student submits work, you give feedback, they read it (maybe), and then they move on to the next project. The feedback never becomes learning.

*[VISUAL: Linear path showing "Submit → Feedback → Move On" with a red X]*

The solution is a *revision loop*—a cycle where students act on feedback, resubmit, and demonstrate improvement.

*[VISUAL: Circular loop showing "Submit → Feedback → Revise → Resubmit"]*

Checkpoint 3 asks you to build a two-cycle revision process students can complete in one week. Here's a practical structure:

**Monday: First Draft Due**
Students submit their initial work. You review it and provide feedback using the formula we just covered.

**Tuesday: Feedback Returned + Revision Work Session**
Students receive feedback in class. You give them thirty minutes of work time to start revisions *right there*, while you're available to answer questions.

**Thursday: Revised Draft Due**
Students resubmit. You do a lighter review—focus only on whether they addressed your feedback. If yes, they're done. If not, quick second round.

**Friday: Final Submission**
Students submit the polished version. This is what gets evaluated (if you're grading).

*[VISUAL: Week timeline showing all four days]*

This two-cycle loop does three things:
1. It makes feedback *matter*—students can't ignore it and move on.
2. It teaches revision as a skill—students learn that growth happens in drafts, not in first attempts.
3. It shows progress—you can see the improvement from draft one to draft three.

And here's the key: *You don't give exhaustive feedback on the first draft.* You give targeted feedback on *one or two* high-leverage improvements. That's achievable in a week. Twelve improvements? That's overwhelming.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

The revision loop is what separates YPP from traditional grading models. We're not sorting students into A/B/C buckets. We're coaching them toward mastery.

### [08:00] WHEN FEEDBACK DOESN'T STICK - THE MODELING MOVE

Okay, real scenario: You give a student clear, specific feedback. They revise. They submit again. And... they made the exact same error.

What do you do?

*[VISUAL: Student paper with same mistake circled twice]*

This is where most teachers get frustrated. "I already told them this! Why didn't they fix it?"

Here's the truth: Sometimes students don't understand *how* to apply your feedback. Telling them what to fix isn't enough. You need to *model how to fix it*.

This is the targeted modeling move:

**Step 1: Show, Don't Tell**
Sit down with the student (or pull up their work on a screen). Say: "Let me show you what a strong evidence paragraph looks like." Then write one in front of them. Think aloud as you go.

**Step 2: Have Them Annotate the Difference**
Show them the model you just created and their original paragraph side-by-side. Ask: "What's different? What did I include that you didn't?" Make *them* name the gaps.

**Step 3: Guided Revision**
Now ask them to try revising their own paragraph while you watch. Give real-time micro-feedback: "Good start—now add the citation. Great, now explain *why* that evidence supports your claim."

*[VISUAL: Three-step process shown as a flowchart]*

This takes five minutes. But it's five minutes that transfers the skill. The student doesn't just fix this one paragraph—they learn *how* to write evidence paragraphs going forward.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Model one, transfer many"]*

When feedback doesn't stick, it's usually not because students are lazy. It's because they don't yet have the schema to apply it. Your job is to build that schema.

### [10:00] THE LEARNER CONFERENCE - FIVE MINUTES THAT MATTER

Let's talk about one of the highest-impact feedback strategies: the *learner conference*.

This is a short, one-on-one check-in where you and a student discuss their progress, their goals, and their next steps. It takes five minutes. And it's worth more than twenty rounds of written comments.

*[VISUAL: Instructor and student sitting together, student work open between them]*

Checkpoint 4 asks you to create a 5-minute learner conference protocol. Here's a structure that works:

**Minute 1: Student-Led Opening**
Ask: "What goal are you currently working on, and what evidence shows you're making progress?"

This flips the script. *They* lead. *They* identify the goal. *They* point to evidence. You're not interrogating—you're listening.

**Minutes 2-3: Focused Feedback**
Based on what they shared, give one piece of specific feedback. Use the strength-gap-next-step formula.

Example: "I see you've added evidence to three paragraphs—that's growth. Now let's work on integrating your citations smoothly. Look at this sentence. How could you weave the quote into your own words instead of dropping it in?"

**Minute 4: Co-Create Next Step**
Don't assign the next step—co-create it. Ask: "Based on what we just talked about, what's one thing you'll revise before next class?"

Let them say it. When they own the goal, they're more likely to act on it.

**Minute 5: Document and Close**
Write down the agreed-upon next step (they should too). Say: "Great. I'll check in on this on Thursday. You've got this."

*[VISUAL: Five-step protocol shown as a checklist]*

Notice what this conference does:
✅ It's student-led, not teacher-dominated.
✅ It's focused on growth, not grades.
✅ It's forward-looking.
✅ It builds relationship and accountability.

You can't conference with every student every week. But if you cycle through your roster—five students per class session—you hit everyone twice a month. That's enough to make a difference.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "What goal? What evidence? What's next?"]*

### [11:00] TRACKING GROWTH OVER TIME

Here's the last piece: How do you measure whether students are actually growing?

A single test score doesn't tell you. A single project grade doesn't tell you. Growth is visible when you track *change across time*.

*[VISUAL: Graph showing upward trend across multiple data points]*

Checkpoint 5 asks you to map the data points you'll track to evidence learner growth. Here are five options:

**1. Criterion-Level Rubric Scores**
Don't just track overall scores. Track individual criteria. Did their "evidence use" improve from project one to project three, even if their overall grade stayed the same? That's growth.

**2. Revision Quality**
How much did the work improve from draft one to draft three? Students who show big jumps in revision are building the skill of self-improvement.

**3. Self-Assessment Accuracy**
Can students accurately identify their own strengths and gaps? Track how their self-assessments align with your assessments. As they get better at this, they become independent learners.

**4. Conference Goals Met**
Did the student achieve the next step they committed to in their last conference? Track completion rates over time.

**5. Formative Check Trends**
Are their thumbs-up checks increasing? Are their exit ticket responses showing deeper understanding? Formative data patterns show growth even before summative assessments.

*[VISUAL: All five data points listed on screen]*

Pick two or three that fit your class structure. You don't need a complex spreadsheet—a simple tracker in a shared doc works fine.

The goal isn't to measure everything. The goal is to show students: "Look, here's evidence that you're getting better." That visible progress builds confidence and momentum.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

### [11:30] APPLICATION BRIDGE - FROM VIDEO TO CHECKPOINTS

Let's connect this to your five checkpoints.

*[VISUAL: Flowchart showing how checkpoints build on each other]*

**Checkpoint 1** asks you to define four criteria aligned to your class objective. Make them observable and specific. "Good writing" is not a criterion. "Uses evidence to support claims" is.

**Checkpoint 2** is your feedback stem bank. Use the strength-gap-next-step formula. Write ten stems and practice giving feedback out loud using them.

**Checkpoint 3** is your two-cycle revision loop. Map out the timeline: When is draft one due? When do students get feedback? When do they revise? Make it fit within one week so momentum doesn't die.

**Checkpoint 4** is your conference protocol. Use the five-minute structure I gave you, but adapt the questions for your content area. Practice it with a colleague or a friend before you try it with a student.

**Checkpoint 5** is your growth tracking plan. Pick two data points you'll track consistently. Set up a simple system—don't overcomplicate it. The tracker only works if you actually use it.

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

These checkpoints prepare you to make feedback a *system*, not a random act.

---

### [12:00] CLOSE - FEEDBACK AS RELATIONSHIP

Here's the final truth about feedback: It's not a technical skill. It's a relational one.

*[VISUAL: Instructor and student collaborating over a project]*

Students will only act on your feedback if they trust that you care about their growth. If they think you're just checking boxes or sorting them into rankings, they'll tune out.

But if they believe you see their potential, believe they can improve, and are willing to invest time in helping them get there? They'll revise. They'll conference. They'll push themselves.

*[ON-SCREEN TEXT: "Feedback without relationship is just noise"]*

That's why we use strengths-based language. That's why we co-create next steps instead of assigning them. That's why we build revision loops instead of one-and-done grading.

It's all in service of one message: *You're capable of growth, and I'm here to support it.*

*[PAUSE 2 SEC]*

So go build those criteria. Draft those feedback stems. Design that revision loop. And remember: The goal isn't to evaluate students. It's to elevate them.

You've got this.

## PACING NOTES
- Total word count: ~1,820 words
- Average speaking pace: 140 words/minute = 13 minutes
- The feedback formula section (04:00-06:00) should be delivered with clear, deliberate pacing—these are concrete templates
- The conference protocol (10:00-11:00) should feel conversational and warm—model the tone you want instructors to use
- The close (12:00-13:00) should slow down slightly and feel encouraging—this is motivational
- Sections marked [PAUSE 2 SEC] are built into timing
