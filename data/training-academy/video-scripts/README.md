## Script Features

Each script includes:

### Core Content
- **Timestamp markers** every 2 minutes for production planning
- **Visual cue suggestions** for slides, diagrams, and graphics
- **Emphasis markers** for key terms that should be highlighted
- **Pacing notes** (pauses, speed variations, tone guidance)
- **Real classroom scenarios** (2-3 per module) for concrete examples

### Production Support
- **On-screen text recommendations** (3-5 key phrases per module)
- **B-roll suggestions** (5-7 classroom footage moments per module)
- **Accessibility notes** for visual-dependent content
- **Word count and timing calculations** to ensure accurate duration

### Pedagogical Alignment
- Scripts directly prepare learners for all 6 quiz questions per module
- Checkpoint tasks are explicitly addressed and scaffolded
- Cross-module themes reinforced: student-centeredness, equity lens, practical over perfect, growth mindset, community orientation

## Usage Guidelines

### For Video Production
1. Read scripts aloud at **140 words per minute** conversational pace
2. Follow [PAUSE] and pacing notes for natural delivery
3. Use visual cues to trigger slide changes or b-roll transitions
4. Include on-screen text overlays at specified timestamps
5. Ensure all visual content has verbal descriptions for accessibility

### For Script Customization
- Examples can be adapted to different subject areas (coding, design, writing, STEM)
- Tone is warm and peer-coach style—maintain this throughout
- If adding content, ensure total duration stays within ±30 seconds of target
- All quiz concepts must remain embedded in the content

### For Review and Quality Assurance
Each script should be evaluated against:
- ✅ Runs to time when read at conversational pace
- ✅ All 6 quiz questions are implicitly taught
- ✅ All 5 checkpoints are explicitly addressed
- ✅ Includes 2+ real classroom scenarios
- ✅ Ends with concrete action step
- ✅ Feels like mentorship, not corporate training

## Implementation Notes

### Production Order Recommendation
1. **Module 1** (Foundation) - Shoot first to establish tone and visual style
2. **Module 3** (Lesson Design) - Core instructional content
3. **Module 2** (Culture) - Build on foundation with practical scenarios
4. **Module 4** (Feedback) - Advanced pedagogy
5. **Module 5** (Capstone) - Culminating synthesis

### Presenter Guidance
- Use "you" language throughout (conversational, not academic)
- Model the instructional tone you want teachers to adopt (warm, clear, supportive)
- When delivering example scripts or dialogue, shift tone to demonstrate
- Maintain energy—these are not dry lectures, they're coaching sessions
- Smile when appropriate, especially during encouragement sections

### Post-Production
- Add chapter markers at each major section for easy navigation
- Include downloadable PDFs of key graphics (intervention ladder, rubrics, checklists)
- Provide auto-generated transcripts for accessibility
- Create 2-minute summary clips for social media/marketing
